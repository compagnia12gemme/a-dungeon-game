You are an Adventurer.

You possess 2d6&nbsp;×&nbsp;10sp.

You know nothing, but you will learn.

To create a character:
* Roll your attributes
* Determine health
* Roll an occupation
* Choose Scars
* Learn Rituals (optional)
* Roll an Extra

Alternatively, use the random character generator at the bottom of this page.

## Roll Attributes
There are three attributes: Agility, Brawn, and Cunning.

**Agility:** Dodge things, tumble and climb, make ranged attacks, run.  
**Brawn:** Hit things, lift and push, make melee attacks, resist.  
**Cunning:** Spot things, sneak and deceive, wield magic, hide.

Determine them by rolling 3d6 in order. You may swap two results.

## Determine Health

Roll 1d6 and add half your Brawn score (rounded down) to determine your starting health.

You always roll with advantage when performing tasks related to your vocation.

## Choose Scars

The more violence you do over the course of your adventure, the more Scars you accumulate. All characters start play with one historic Scar.

If you want to think about how you earned it then do so. if you don’t, don’t. Sometimes it’s best not to dwell on the past.

Every time you make a roll in combat you may modify it by +/- X, where X is the number of Scars you possess.

Choose your starting Scar from the lists below, or roll 1d6 to determine your Scar location followed by 1d6 on the relevant list to determine the nature of the Scar.

Head
Face
Arms
Hands
Legs
Torso

### Head

1. The tip of one of your ears is hacked off.
1. A flap of skin was sheared away from your scalp, revealing exposed bone. The skin will never grow back.
1. Your ear becomes permanently swollen and deformed, resembling a cauliflower.
1. There’s no physical sign that you were injured, but you’ve become prone to apocalyptic headaches that come on without warning.
1. The dome of your head is visibly mis-shapen, and helmets don’t fit like they used to.
1. Hair only grows on one side of your head now. The other side is knotted with scar tissue.

### Face

1. A broken tooth pierced your lip. Your mouth is crooked and your lip is permanently a little swollen.
1. The blade caught you in your mouth, slicing straight through your cheek. The scar extends up to just below your cheek bone, and it’s a beautiful shade of dead-flesh-white.
1. You never use all of your teeth at the same time anyway. Don’t worry - you’ll get used to only being able to chew on one side eventually.
1. The blow shattered your orbital bone, leaving your eye hanging out of your skull. The bones didn’t set quite right and your eye is visibly lower in your face than it used to be.
1. Your nose oozes a small trickle of blood constantly.
1. One of your cheeks is noticeably lower than the other, with a visible lump where the bone didn’t set properly.

### Arms

1. You fractured your shoulder socket. The joint sometimes catches so your arm locks in place and has to be forced back into motion, often painfully. The joint grinds audibly when it moves.
1. One of the tendons in your forearm is permanently damaged. Now your hand flops a little too far back at the wrist.
1. The bones of your wrist didn’t quite line up properly when you healed and now there’s a very visible misalignment where your wrist joins your hand.
1. Your arm hung limp by your side for so long before you set it and healed that your shoulder now sits a little lower than its opposite number.
1. Elbows are made to bend, and that’s a good thing because yours will never be able to extend fully again.
1. Your arm is twisted so that when you stand the back of your hand sits at a right angle to your body, the thumb parallel to your thigh.

### Hands

1. You lose the tip of one of your fingers, just below the nail.
1. The fractured bones of your ring finger rotated slightly during healing and now it overlaps your middle finger every time you make a fist.
1. One of your fingers has had all the meat and sinew torn away from it, so that only bone remains.
1. The skin of your hand is boiled and charred, like meat left on the fire for too long.
1. The veins in the back of your hand are thick and black like they carry an infection.
1. Pick your favourite finger and say goodbye to it. It’s gone now.

### Legs

1. The bones in your leg were shattered beyond complete repair. That leg will always be fractionally shorter than the other.
1. One of your feet twists inward at an odd angle, and can never be straightened properly.
1. One of your kneecaps has been shifted sideways so that it rests on the outside of your leg.
1. You lose a foot, forever. Find something to replace it with.
1. Your kneecap is shattered, leaving free-floating chunks of bone just beneath your skin.
1. Your ankle is crushed, and heals with a large, visible lump.

### Torso

1. Your chest is visibly concave, the result of poorly-set broken ribs.
1. Most bruises heal. This one didn’t. The skin where you were struck is permanently stained a dull shade of piss-yellow, with hints of brown and flecks of purple.
1. Your pectoral muscle is separated from the bone, and when it heals your chest on that side is lower than the other.
1. A thick knot of scar tissue runs down the center of your chest, as though you have been zipped up.
1. Your stomach was split open and poorly stitched, and now you have no visible belly button.
1. After breaking all of your ribs on one side, a metal plate was grafted onto your bones. It shines through the hole in your missing flesh.

## Learn Rituals (Optional)

All characters can learn magic, but it comes at a cost. You can start with as many Rituals as you dare to learn. If you overextend yourself and your health or any attribute reaches 0, your character has died. Make a new one.

To learn a Ritual, roll on the Ritual Generator or choose something from another game. Then roll 1d3 and reduce either your maximum health or one of your attributes by that amount permanently. Once you have decided to learn a Ritual you can’t change your mind - you have to roll and pay the price.

### Spells from other games

Instead of rolling 1d3 when attempting to learn a new Ritual, reduce your maximum health or one of your attributes by the level of the spell you are attempting to learn. Back to top
